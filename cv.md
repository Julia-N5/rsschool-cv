## My Goals

My goals are to learn programming and become a good programmer. I have some work experience, but I did little coding myself because I received a lot of help with coding. I worked on a project using React, but I can't show the code as the application is active. In the future, I want to learn animation and use different frameworks in JavaScript.And of course, find myself in the IT world.
